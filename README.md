## 2. A responsive portfolio showcasing my expertise in **Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI**. Built with pure HTML/CSS/JS and deployed via GitHub Pages.
The Portfolio is a meticulously crafted, responsive showcase of expertise in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI. Designed with a modern, minimalist aesthetic, this interactive platform highlights hands-on experience through dynamic project case studies: Including a 92.8%-accurate fraud detection model and a medical diagnosis predictor with 98% precision, each paired with technical deep dives and expertise. The site features an elegant timeline of technical milestones, such as impactful internships at IBM and Emerging Five, alongside a curated skills matrix spanning Python, TensorFlow, and statistical analysis. A user-centric contact system, powered by Formspree, enables seamless communication with auto-resetting forms and intelligent notifications. Built with semantic HTML5, CSS3 animations, and vanilla JavaScript, this portfolio prioritizes performance, accessibility, and cross-device compatibility while reflecting rigorous attention to detail in both code and design.
